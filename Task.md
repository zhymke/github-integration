# Platform Lunar backend homework

## Functional Requirements

Implement a service that connects to GitHub API and retrieves a list of 10 most active (as defined by the  number of stars) Java frameworks.

For each framework identified the following attributes must be exposed by your REST API:

- General info:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Licence name
  - Link to the repo
  - Whether or not current user (see below) has put a star on the repo
- Key metrics:
  - Number of contributors (including anonymous)
  - Number of stars

The API should make it possible to return the entries sorted by either key metric so user could query something like: `list top 10 most active Java frameworks and those with the least number of contributors should be listed first`.

To give it some personal touch, the API should allow starring/un-starring a repo. Obviously, this requires authenticating against GitHub. The presence or absence of a personal star is included in the API response as described above.

To summarize, your REST API should expose endpoints to:

1. Query the most active frameworks, with or without oneâ€™s own GitHub credentials supplied (if they are supplied, the response includes whether or not the repo is starred by the user)
1. Star the repo
1. Un-star the repo

## Technical Requirements

1. The code is written in any JVM language (e.g. Java / Groovy / Scala / Clojure / Kotlin) or a reasonable mix of those
1. Your build scripts produce a Docker image which runs with minimal fuss:
  `$ docker run image-tag` or even `$ docker-compose up`

## Evaluation Criteria

- Convenience of building and running the application, making as little assumptions about OS, Maven/Gradle versions installed, etc. Ideally, JDK and Docker should suffice.
- Code is readable, tidy and is consistent in style and formatting
- Effort to minimize boilerplate code imposed by the language or framework of choice
- Code is well structured into packages
- Clear and concise README
- Reasonable use of version control and commit messages
- Functional requirements fulfilled and covered by tests
- Value of the test code and its focus on asserting functionality vs. implementation details
- [Soundness](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/soundness) of REST API design
- Effectiveness of retrieving information from GitHub API
- Simplicity of overall approach and lack of over-engineering
